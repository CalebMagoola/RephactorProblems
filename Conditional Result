Write code that sets the value of a variable named result to the sum of the values 
in the variables num1 and num2, unless that sum is in the range 20 to 30, inclusive, in which case set result to 0. 
Assume all variables have been declared and that num1 and num2 already have values. 
Use only one if statement in your solution.
/////////////////////
if (num1 + num2 >= 20 && num1 + num2 <= 30)
    result = 0;
else
    result = num1 + num2;
