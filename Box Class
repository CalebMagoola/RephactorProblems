//Write a complete class called Box that represents a cardboard box with dimensions of length, width, and height. 
//Include a constructor that has three int parameters names length, width, and height for the three dimensions, 
//and a getVolume method that returns an int with the calculated volume of the box (length x width x height).

//Answer
public class Box
{
    private int length;
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Box (int length, int width, int height)
    {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    public int getVolume()
    {
         return (this.length * this.width * this.height);
