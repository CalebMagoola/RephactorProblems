public class TreasureChest{
    private int gold;
   
    public TreasureChest(){
        gold = 0;
    }
    public TreasureChest(int g){
        this.gold = g;
    }
    
    public int getGold(){
        return gold;
    }
    
    public void setGold(int g){
        gold = g;
    }

    public String toString(){
        return "This chest contains " + getGold() + " gold pieces!";
