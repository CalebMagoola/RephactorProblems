//Write a method called computePay that accepts arguments representing the hourly wage of an employee (a double) 
//and the number of hours that employee worked this week (an int) in that order. 
//The method should return the take home pay owed to the employee as a double value.
//The normal work week is 40 hours, and the company pays employees "time and a half" for overtime. 
//So, the total wages is the sum of regular wages and overtime wages. 
//Regular wages are the hours worked (up to 40) times the hourly wage. 
//Overtime wages are any hours over 40 times the hourly wage times 1.5.
//The employee's take home pay is the total wages minus taxes and medical costs. 
//Taxes are 20% of the total wages, and medical costs are 10% of the total wages.
//Suppose an employee makes $12.25 per hour and has worked 45 hours this week. 
//The take home pay for that employee is 40 hours times 12.25, plus 5 hours times 18.375 (time-and-a-half), minus taxes and medical, for a total of $407.31.
